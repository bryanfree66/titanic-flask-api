# titanic-flask-api-hosting

A very quick exploration of titanic data, with model hosting using Flask. I only had about 2 days to do this exercise, so I did only very basic feature engineering in a SKLearn pipeline. I deployed the final trained model and pipeline in a Flask API.

1. Create new Python virtual environment
2. Restore packages with pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Start the API: python app.py
4. Use the Postman collection to submit inference request
